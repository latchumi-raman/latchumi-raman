## About Me
I am a Software Development Engineer with a strong focus on AI and Machine Learning systems. I enjoy building scalable, production-ready applications that combine solid software engineering principles with data-driven intelligence.

My experience spans backend development, ML model design, NLP systems, and end-to-end AI pipelines through internships, research-driven projects, and real-world deployments.
